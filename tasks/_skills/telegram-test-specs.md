## 1. Why Tokenless Testing

Testing a Telegram bot normally requires a **real bot token** and network calls to `api.telegram.org`. This means:

- Need BotFather token per test
- Tests hit real API (slow, rate-limited)
- Can't run in CI without secrets
- Hard to assert exact API calls

### The harness approach

Instead of calling Telegram's API, the harness:
1. Builds your bot **in-process** (just imports `makeBot()`)
2. Feeds it **synthetic Updates** (no network)
3. **Captures** every outgoing API call the bot tries to make
4. **Compares** captured calls against expected calls

```
BotSpec JSON  →  harness feeds synthetic Updates  →  bot handles them  →  captures API calls  →  compares vs expected
```

No Telegram. No token. No network. Runs anywhere. Deterministic.

### Gate verdict

The harness emits ONE machine-readable line on stdout:

```
GATE:<nonce>:{"ok":true,"total":3,"passed":3,"failed":0,"coverage":{...},"results":[...]}
```

- `ok: true` → all specs pass AND all declared commands covered
- Exit code `0` always (verdict is in JSON; non-zero = harness crashed)
- Nonce authenticates the verdict (bot code can't forge it)

---

## 2. How the Harness Works

### Bot factory

Harness imports your `makeBot()` and calls it fresh per spec:

```ts
import { makeBot } from "./src/index";

// Harness does this internally for each spec:
const bot = makeBot();  // fresh bot, fresh session, fresh state
```

### Capture transformer

The harness installs a grammY **transformer** that intercepts every outgoing API call:

```ts
bot.api.config.use(async (prev, method, payload) => {
  // Instead of calling api.telegram.org:
  calls.push({ method, payload });       // record it
  return { ok: true, result: stub };     // return fake success
});
```

This means `ctx.reply("Hi")`, `ctx.editMessageText(...)`, `ctx.answerCallbackQuery()` — all get captured, none hit the network.

### Fake botInfo

grammY normally calls `getMe` on startup. The harness skips this:

```ts
bot.botInfo = { id: 1, is_bot: true, first_name: "TestBot", username: "test_bot", ... };
```

### Synthetic Updates

The harness builds grammY-compatible Update objects from your spec:

```ts
// { "send": { "text": "/start" } } becomes:
{
  update_id: 1,
  message: {
    message_id: 1,
    chat: { id: 1, type: "private" },
    from: { id: 1, first_name: "User" },
    text: "/start",
    entities: [{ type: "bot_command", offset: 0, length: 6 }]
  }
}
```

- `/command` text auto-gets `bot_command` entity → grammY command router matches
- `chatId` defaults to `1`, `userId` to `1`
- Callback queries include original message → `editMessageText` works

---

## 3. BotSpec Format

A spec file is a JSON object describing a dialog:

```json
{
  "name": "start command greets user",
  "strict": false,
  "steps": [
    {
      "send": { "text": "/start" },
      "expect": [
        { "method": "sendMessage", "payload": { "text": "Welcome!" } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | `string` | yes | Unique, human-readable |
| `strict` | `boolean` | no | Default `false` |
| `steps` | `SpecStep[]` | yes | Ordered user actions + expected responses |

### SpecStep — send (what user does)

Three variants:

```jsonc
// 1. Text message
{ "send": { "text": "/start" } }

// 2. Text with specific chat/user
{ "send": { "text": "/book", "chatId": 42, "userId": 99 } }

// 3. Callback button tap
{ "send": { "callback": "menu:book", "messageId": 100 } }

// 4. Raw Update object (advanced)
{ "send": { "update": { "update_id": 1, "message": {...} } } }
```

### SpecStep — expect (what bot should reply)

```jsonc
// Assert method was called with specific payload (deep-subset match)
{ "method": "sendMessage", "payload": { "text": "Welcome!" } }

// Assert method was called, any payload
{ "method": "editMessageText" }

// Assert method was called (no payload check)
{ "method": "answerCallbackQuery" }
```

**Deep-subset matching:** `payload: { text: "Welcome!" }` matches `{ chat_id: 1, text: "Welcome!", ... }`. You assert what you care about without pinning auto-filled fields like `chat_id`, `message_id`, `parse_mode`.

### Matching modes

**Subsequence (default, `strict: false`):** Every expected call must appear **in order**, but **extra calls are allowed**.

```json
{
  "send": { "callback": "menu:next" },
  "expect": [{ "method": "editMessageText" }]
}
// pass — answerCallbackQuery fired too, but was incidental
```

**Strict (`strict: true`):** Exact count + positional match. Use when "and nothing else" matters.

```json
{
  "strict": true,
  "steps": [
    { "send": { "callback": "menu:next" }, "expect": [
      { "method": "editMessageText" }
    ] }
  ]
}
// fail — answerCallbackQuery fired but wasn't in expect[]
```

Recommendation: subsequence for most specs, strict only for targeted assertions.

## 4. Command Coverage Rules

The gate checks: **every declared command must have >= 1 meaningful spec exercising it.**

A spec is "meaningful" for a command when:
1. The `send` step contains a `/command` text
2. That step's `expect[]` has >= 1 entry

```jsonc
// ✅ Counts toward /book coverage:
{ "send": { "text": "/book" }, "expect": [{ "method": "sendMessage" }] }

// ❌ Does NOT count (empty expect — no assertion):
{ "send": { "text": "/book" }, "expect": [] }

// ❌ Does NOT count (not a command — no bot_command entity added):
{ "send": { "text": "hello" }, "expect": [{ "method": "sendMessage" }] }
```

Commands are **case-sensitive**: `/Book` and `/book` are different. grammY routes them separately, coverage tracks them separately.

**Coverage report (from GATE verdict):**

```json
{
  "declared": ["book", "cancel", "start"],
  "covered": ["book", "start"],
  "missing": ["cancel"],
  "fraction": 0.666
}
```

`fraction: 1` required for gate pass (unless no commands declared → 1 automatically).

---

## 5. Harness CLI

Invoked via the inlined harness CLI (built from `src/toolkit/harness/`
into `dist/toolkit/harness/cli.js` by `npm run build`):

```
AGNTDEV_BOT_MODULE=./src/index.ts      # module exporting makeBot()
AGNTDEV_SPECS_FILE=./specs.json         # JSON array of BotSpec (legacy) OR
AGNTDEV_SPECS_GLOB=./tests/specs/*.json # per-feature pattern (task_manager)
AGNTDEV_COMMANDS_FILE=./commands.json   # string[] of declared commands (optional)
AGNTDEV_GATE_NONCE=abc123               # nonce for verdict auth
```

For `task_manager` projects, set `AGNTDEV_SPECS_GLOB` instead of
`AGNTDEV_SPECS_FILE`. The harness globs the per-feature files and
merges them at gate time. See section 6 below for the full per-feature
pattern.

### Full example: booking bot specs

```json
[
  {
    "name": "/start greets user",
    "steps": [
      { "send": { "text": "/start" }, "expect": [{ "method": "sendMessage", "payload": { "text": "Welcome!" } }] }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "/book flow",
    "steps": [
      { "send": { "text": "/book" }, "expect": [{ "method": "sendMessage", "payload": { "text": "Choose a service:" } }] },
      { "send": { "callback": "select:cut" }, "expect": [{ "method": "editMessageText", "payload": { "text": "Pick a time:" } }] },
      { "send": { "callback": "slot:14:00" }, "expect": [{ "method": "editMessageText", "payload": { "text": "Booked!" } }] }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "/cancel flow",
    "steps": [
      { "send": { "text": "/cancel" }, "expect": [{ "method": "sendMessage" }] },
      { "send": { "callback": "confirm:cancel:yes" }, "expect": [{ "method": "editMessageText", "payload": { "text": "Cancelled." } }] }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Bot factory | `export function makeBot()` — fresh bot per spec |
| No network | Capture transformer + fake botInfo |
| Synthetic input | `{ text: "/cmd" }`, `{ callback: "data" }`, `{ update: {...} }` |
| Expected output | `{ method: "sendMessage", payload: { text: "Hi" } }` (deep subset) |
| Verdict | `GATE:<nonce>:{"ok":bool, ...}` on stdout |
| Coverage | Every declared command needs >= 1 non-empty expect spec |

## 6. Per-feature spec files (task_manager projects)

`task_manager` projects (those with `build_pipeline=task_manager` — see
[agnt-cli-builder](../agnt-cli-builder/SKILL.md) "What flow am I on?")
organize their test specs as **one JSON file per feature task** in
`tests/specs/<slug>.json`. The platform globs and merges them at gate
time, so each file is independent.

### File layout

```
my-bot/
├── tests/
│   ├── specs/
│   │   ├── T01.json      # one file per feature task
│   │   ├── T02.json
│   │   └── T03.json
│   ├── helpers.ts        # if you use programmatic tests (see advanced skill)
│   └── start.test.ts
```

Each file is a JSON array of `BotSpec` objects (same shape as section 3
above). Example `tests/specs/T02.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "T02: /balance shows the user's TON balance",
    "steps": [
      { "send": { "text": "/balance" }, "expect": [
        { "method": "sendMessage", "payload": { "text": "Balance: 42.5 TON" } }
      ] }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Why per-file (not one big specs.json)?

- **No merge conflicts.** Multiple agents work on different features
  in parallel; one spec file per feature means no shared-file gridlock.
- **Per-task coverage.** The platform's gate maps each spec file to
  the task slug in its filename. Coverage is checked per-task, not
  globally — so failing the T03 specs doesn't block T02 from passing.
- **Decompose-driven.** The `task_manager` decompose step writes one
  spec file per feature task automatically. You can override or
  extend them; you don't have to author from scratch.

### Writing a per-feature spec

The spec file content is the same `BotSpec` JSON shape as section 3
above. The only difference is the file location: `tests/specs/<slug>.json`
instead of one big `specs.json`. The slug in the filename **must**
match the task slug exactly (case-sensitive).

### When the gate runs

When the platform runs the Tests stage for a `task_manager` project,
it globs `tests/specs/*.json`, merges them into one in-memory array,
and runs the harness against the union. Per-spec GATE results are
attributed back to the source file (so a failure on T02's specs
shows up as "T02 spec failed" in the platform's review verdict).

> **The gate is fail-closed (agnt-api PRs f1e942b + 03f55aa).** A missing
> or unreadable per-feature spec file is a **hard** `GATE:<nonce>:{"ok":false,...,"error":"..."}`
> — not a silent skip. Skipped specs (e.g. spec files the platform
> can't fetch or parse) are surfaced in the verdict with a reason.
> If the gate is failing on a "skipped" line, the fix is the spec file
> itself, not the gate.

If your project has BOTH legacy and task_manager tests (e.g. you're
migrating), the per-feature pattern takes precedence. The platform
ignores a top-level `specs.json` if `tests/specs/*.json` exists.

## Common mistakes

1. **Empty `expect[]` on command send** — inflates coverage but asserts nothing. Harness rejects it.
2. **Forgetting `answerCallbackQuery`** — subsequence matching hides this, but real users see stuck spinner.
3. **`strict: true` without including incidental calls** — almost every callback handler fires `answerCallbackQuery`. Include it in expect if strict.
4. **Relying on session across specs** — harness creates fresh bot per spec. Session starts from `initial()` each time.
5. **Not declaring all commands** — coverage gate uses the declared list. Handler without spec = gate fails.
6. **Case mismatch** — `/Book` declared, spec sends `/book` → different commands in coverage.
